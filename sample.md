Output (your response):
CV Matches Job — 8%

Description why:
The CV of Maxim N. as a Front-end developer with experience in React, Typescript, Redux, Figma, Jira, Linear, and Kanban does not closely match the job requirements for an Engineering Manager position at Sapar LLC. While the CV does have relevant technical skills such as Jira and Kanban, it lacks the overall experience in managing software development projects, leading Agile ceremonies, managing software engineers, working with product managers, and ensuring quality in software development. Additionally, the CV does not mention experience in iOS and Android application development, database technologies, SDLC phases, and architecture understanding which are crucial requirements for the Engineering Manager role. Hence, the match is minimal at 8%.
